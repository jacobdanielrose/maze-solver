# 🧩 Maze Solver

**Course Project for Boot.dev Backend Developer Course**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a **maze solver** developed as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) backend developer course. The project is designed to help students develop core programming skills, including algorithmic thinking, data structures, and Python application development.

> 🚧 This project was developed as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) Backend Developer curriculum.
> It serves as an introductory project to practice implementing algorithms in a practical application.
> This one in particular uses the DFS (depth first search) to solve the maze.
